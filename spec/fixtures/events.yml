We meet the second Sunday of the month from 2-3:30 pm at Jerry’s Artarama to exchange marketing ideas and learn from each other about marketing our art…. on-line, in galleries, at art fairs, in the neighborhood. Topic: What Copyright Laws protect your art work. Get the scoop from a lawyer!<br\\/>This issue comes up at almost every meeting. Since many artists in all mediums have a Website or Blog where they post pictures of their work for sale, we are all concerned about protecting our work from internet pirates and thieves. Mathew Booth, an attorney with 23 years of experience in intellectual property, copyright and trademark legal practice has graciously consented to help us understand this complicated subject.<\\/p> <p>What is a copyright? Is your work copyright protected if you don’t file a formal copyright? When do you need to file a copyright? How expensive is it? How difficult is it to file a copyright? How long does a copyright protect your work? Does it protect your work internationally? How enforceable is a copyright? What if you write, illustrate and electronically publish a book?

Voted BEST COMEDY TROUPE four years in a row by the readers of the Austin Chronicle, MASTER PANCAKE features slacker wise-cracker John Erler, his partner Joe Parsons, and a rotating band of Austin's funniest comics going up against the worst that Hollywood has to offer. Recent Master Pancake \\\"hits\\\" include vampire teen romance juggernaut TWILIGHT, web-slinging super franchise SPIDER-MAN, and '80s cyborg classic ROBOCOP. Plus, don't miss their periodic installments of CHOOSE YOUR OWN PANCAKE (the audience picks the film, and they mock it unrehearsed!), STAR TREK MOCK (pitting the likes of Kirk vs Picard, and Next Gen Klingons vs classic Klingons!), and VIDEO JUKEBOX (mocking music videos all the way from the '80s to today)!

It's smart, fast, and bust-a-gut funny. Voted BEST COMEDY TROUPE four years in a row by the readers of the Austin Chronicle, MASTER PANCAKE features slacker wise-cracker John Erler, his partner Joe Parsons, and a rotating band of Austin's funniest comics going up against the worst that Hollywood has to offer. Recent Master Pancake \"hits\" include vampire teen romance juggernaut TWILIGHT, web-slinging super franchise SPIDER-MAN, and '80s cyborg classic ROBOCOP. Plus, don't miss their periodic installments of CHOOSE YOUR OWN PANCAKE (the audience picks the film, and they mock it unrehearsed!), STAR TREK MOCK (pitting the likes of Kirk vs Picard, and Next Gen Klingons vs classic Klingons!), and VIDEO JUKEBOX (mocking music videos all the way from the '80s to today)!
